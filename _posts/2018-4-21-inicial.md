I'm interested in all the multidisciplinary aspects related to command and control in emergency services, especially fire services.

A particular topic that interests me especially are all the advances of the neurosciences (and computers) in relation to decision making, both in the EOC and on the ground.

Another issue that interests me is also the automatization and visualization techniques of all operational documents of a fire service in order to provide the necessary information at the right time during an incident.

If there's something you want to send me... it's welcome ...
