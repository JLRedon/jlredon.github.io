I'm interested in any aspect related to command and control in emergency services, particularly in fire services. For example, the implications of the new findings of the neurosciences, and computer technologies (automation, visualization of information ... etc) in their relationship with decision making and document and operational management, both in the EOC, in the communication centers, as in the place of the incident. It is always about providing the right information at the right time, and it is not easy to manage and visualize this highly dynamic information in the command posts (I think of the coordination of multiple resources in a large forest fire).

Any information that improves my knowledge on these topics (C4) will be welcome.
