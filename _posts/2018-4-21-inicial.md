I’m very interested in any aspects related to command and control in emergency services but particularly in fire services. An example would be, the implications of the new findings of the neurosciences, computer technologies (automation, visualization of information… etc.) in their relationship with decision making, documentation, and operational management, both in the EOC, and in the communication centers along with the place of the incident. It is always about providing the right information at the right time, and it is not easy to manage and visualize this highly dynamic information in the command posts (I visualize this as in the coordination of multiple resources in a large forest fire).

Any information that improves my knowledge on these topics (C4) will be welcome.
